Advanced Programming Assignment 1
House Price Trends

I have attempted the following sections:

- the core application
- code quality
- SQLite database
- Swing UI

Due to a difficult period in my personal life I have not been able to commit as much of my energy and time to this
project as I would have liked, hence why I have not attempted the graphing section. I am fairly happy with the Swing interface,
but my class structure could be improved upon. I have implemented a filter for the 'commercial' properties, and filters for 
minimum and maximum prices. I have also ensured users have the ability to sort the columns of the table by clicking on the headers.
